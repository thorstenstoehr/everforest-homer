# Everforest-Homer
Inspired by the [Everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest) theme. This is my take on bringing Everforest to the [Homer Dashboard](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer).

Thanks to the [Catppuccin Theme for Homer](https://github.com/mrpbennett/catppuccin-homer) which helped a lot to understand how themes for Homer work.
